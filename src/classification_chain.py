        Your task is to determine whether a news article describes a Militarized Interstate Confrontation (MIC).

        A Militarized Interstate Confrontation (MIC) is defined as:
        - A direct confrontation between two or more countries
        - Involving military forces (army, navy, air force, etc.)
        - Where there is a threat, display, or use of military force

        The article must describe an actual military interaction, not just diplomatic tensions or discussions about potential conflicts.

        Analyze the following article carefully and determine if it describes a MIC.
        Output your answer in the specified JSON format with two fields:
        1. is_mic: true if it's a MIC, false if it's not
        2. explanation: Very short explanation of your reasoning

        Here are some examples to guide you:
        Example 1:
        Article: Russian troops opened fire on Ukrainian soldiers near the border, killing three and wounding seven others. The Ukrainian government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty.
        Output: {{"is_mic": true, "explanation": "This article describes a direct military confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian forces with fatalities, which is a clear case of a Militarized Interstate Confrontation."}}

        Example 2:
        Article: China and Taiwan held diplomatic talks aimed at easing tensions in the region. Both sides agreed to maintain open lines of communication to prevent misunderstandings.
        Output: {{"is_mic": false, "explanation": "This article describes diplomatic talks rather than a military confrontation. No military forces were involved, and there was no threat or use of force."}}

        Example 3:
        Article: North Korean forces fired artillery shells into South Korean waters as a show of force during joint US-South Korean military exercises. No casualties were reported.
        Output: {{"is_mic": true, "explanation": "This article describes a militarized action (artillery fire) by North Korea directed at South Korea, which constitutes a Militarized Interstate Confrontation even without casualties."}}

        Example 4:
        Article: The United Nations Security Council met to discuss increasing tensions between India and Pakistan but no military actions were reported.
        Output: {{"is_mic": false, "explanation": "This article only mentions diplomatic discussions about tensions. It does not describe any actual military confrontation, threat, or use of force between countries."}}
